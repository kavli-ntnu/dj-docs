[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/moser-pipelines/badge/?version=latest)](https://moser-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**WARNING! This branch is a frozen copy of the documentation representating the final state of the `dj-moser-imaging` branch of the Imaging Pipeline.**

It is maintained for the benefit of those who may be searching for historically published data. Changes will NOT be accepted to this branch.

If you have arrived here as an active user of the _current_ imaging pipeline, please go to the `master` branch of the repository. 

## Notes

Something about the `docutils` package v0.17.1 breaks bullet pointed lists. Currently pinned to 0.16, review when either 0.17.2 or 0.18 comes out
