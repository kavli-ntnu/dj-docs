==================================================

**WARNING! This is a frozen branch of the documentation representating the final state of the ``dj-moser-imaging`` branch of the Imaging Pipeline in January 2022.**

It is provided for users who may be searching the older version of the pipeline for historically published data. Active users of the current pipeline should search for the ``latest`` version of these documents, which reflect the substantial changes that were made to the Imaging pipeline reflecting the focus of the Moser research group.
