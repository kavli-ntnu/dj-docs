Imaging pipeline terminology
======================================

.. _Imaging Terminology:

Due to the divergent development process, some different terminology has evolved between the imaging and ephys pipelines. This page, and it's :ref:`Ephys twin<Ephys Terminology>`, will cover some of the distinctions. 


MetaSessions and Sessions
-------------------------------

In the Imaging pipeline, the top level object for grouping data together is the **MetaSession**, approximately equal to the *Session* in the Ephys pipeline. It is *not* completely identical.

A **MetaSession** collectively labels one or more sets of imaging and tracking data together. All imaging data in a **MetaSession** is analysed as a single group within **Suite2P**, and unit IDs are consistent within that **MetaSession**.

A **Session** is a single group of data (tiff stacks, tracking etc) generated by a microscope. A **Session** is associated with a single arena, a single tracking system, and so on. 

A **BaseFolder** is the *physical location on disk* where your data is stored, created by ScanImage, and is the key to ingesting data via the :ref:`Imaging Web GUI<Imaging ingestion>`. Data in a single **BaseFolder** does *not* necessarily correspond to a single **MetaSession** (see the discussion of the *combined* in the :ref:`Imaging Web GUI<Imaging ingestion>` page).



Data Sets
---------------

The Imaging pipeline keeps track of data files stored in the **BaseFolder**. If changes are made to the data in the **BaseFolder** (e.g. curating units identified by **Suite2P**), you should re-ingest the **BaseFolder** via the :ref:`Web GUI<Imaging ingestion>`. Only files that have changed will be re-ingested. 

A Data Set may consist of one or more physical files relating to a specific kind of data. For example, "Tif" or "Tracking" or "DLC".



Setups and Scopes
--------------------

The Imaging pipeline separates the concetp of **setup** from that of **Scope**. 

- A **Setup** describes the majority of the experimental hardware, photodetectors, lasers, calibrations, etc.

- A **Scope** describes the microscope objective and scanner, corresponding to specific fields of view, warping/dewarping proceedures etc. This is relevant only for the experimental miniscopes, as the Femontics system, the **Scope** cannot be changed.
