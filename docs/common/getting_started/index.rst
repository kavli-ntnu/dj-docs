This page provides details to help you get started with Datajoint at the Moser group. 

The Datajoint interface is available in both Python and Matlab. Screening analysis is performed by both Python (`Opexebo <https://github.com/kavli-ntnu/opexebo>`_) and Matlab (`Behavioural Neurology Toolbox <https://bitbucket.org/cnc-ntnu/bnt/src/master/>`_). Data may be fetched in either Python or Matlab for more advanced analysis, depending on user preferences. Additional tools (for example: data export for publication) are provided in Python.

If you are new to programming, it is recommended to begin with Python. More experienced coders should choose whichever language they feel most comfortable in.
