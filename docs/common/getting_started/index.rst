Datajoint is available as a package in both Python and Matlab. Due to general demand, the Python version typically recieves updates first, and tat any given time, it is *possible* that parts of the pipeline will *not* be available via MatLab due to missing features. 

Primary development, testing, and support takes place in Python. 

If you are new to programming, it is recommended to begin with Python. More experienced coders should choose whichever language they feel most comfortable in.
