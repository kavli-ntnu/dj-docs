Ephys: Overview
========================

The ephys schema was built to handle electrophysical data generated by a variety of legacy and current tetrodes and probes in use in the Moser Group.

The Ephys schema is written in Python using the Datajoint database framework

New users may find the following pages to be useful:

* :ref:`Ephys fetching`:

  Access The Database schemas in Python, and find the tables you need

* :ref:`Ephys Terminology` and :ref:`Ephys naming`:

  What do terms mean in the Ephys pipeline, and how should things be named

* :ref:`Ephys web-gui`:

  How to use the electrophysiology web interface to ingest new data


The following pages cover more advanced topics and are provided for reference:

  Following the same unit across multiple clusterings



Ephys systems Supported
-------------------------

The following current hardware systems are supported:

* `Neuropixel probes <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/>`_

  * Neuropixels 1.0
  * Neuropixels 2.0

* `Neurologger Wireless <https://www.tse-systems.com/product-details/neurologger/>`_

The following legacy hardware systems are supported:

* `Axona Data Acquisition <http://www.axona.com/products/digital>`_

* `Neuralynx <https://neuralynx.com/hardware/systems-overview>`_

Tracking systems supported
--------------------------------

Both Axona and Neuralynx inbuilt tracking systems are supported.

3 dimensional tracking is supported via `Optitrack motion capture <https://optitrack.com/>`_

`DeepLabCut <https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut>`_ is currently supported for 2 dimensional tracking only. 3 dimensional tracking may be implemented in future. 

Clustering supported
-----------------------------

Current systems, especially Neuropixels recordings, are assumed to be clustered via Kilosort 2.

* `Kilosort 2 <https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort>`_

* `MClust <http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/mclust/MClust.html>`_

* `Klustakwik <https://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
