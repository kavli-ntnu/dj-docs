## What to do if something goes wrong

Both the ephys and imaging pipelines are extremely complicated software systems with many moving parts. It is possible for things to go wrong. 

This page lists some of the common errors that researchers have experienced, and what you can do about it. If your problem doesn't fit into any of these categories, or the answer is not helpful, then contact Simon Ball for assistance.

When assistance is needed, we can help you faster if you provide as much precise information up-front as possible.
